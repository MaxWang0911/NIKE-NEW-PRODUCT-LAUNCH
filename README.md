# 🏃‍♂️ Conjoint Analysis & Regression-Based Product Design for Nike

This project presents a **real-world marketing analytics case** conducted for Nike, focused on new product development through **conjoint analysis**, **segmentation**, and **data-driven targeting strategies**. Using a complete pipeline from **survey design** to **regression modeling**, the team identified optimal product attributes and validated consumer preferences using **real Amazon sales data**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Nike, facing fierce competition and shifting consumer trends, seeks to launch a new product targeting Gen Z and millennial markets. The key challenge:  
**How can Nike design and price a new product to maximize market share and profitability while aligning with customer preferences?**

---

## 🧠 Approach & Analysis

### 1. Survey & Data Collection
- Designed using **Qualtrics**, capturing consumer preferences across 5 core attributes:
  - Shoe type
  - Colour
  - Price
  - Shape (e.g., low-top/high-top)
  - Material
- Participants ranked alternative product concepts using **conjoint survey methodology**.

### 2. Data Analysis (Excel)
- **Attribute utility scores** were calculated to quantify consumer preferences.
- **Cluster analysis** identified two major market segments:
  - **Cluster 1:** Price-sensitive, male-dominated millennials
  - **Cluster 2:** Gen-Z, gender-balanced, design-oriented

### 3. Behavioral Insights
- Regression analysis quantified the effect of each attribute on preference.
- Visualized behavioral patterns using **Canva** and Excel.
- Found a **high correlation between predicted preferences and actual Amazon best-sellers** — confirming the model's accuracy.

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **Price** and **type of sport** are the most influential factors.
- Cluster 2 (Gen Z) showed lower price sensitivity and stronger brand loyalty → high-profit potential.
- Concept 1 (running shoe, black, low-top, $150) best aligns with both data and market validation.
- **Amazon market data** confirmed:
  - 9 out of 10 top-ranked shoes matched our model's attributes.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

- Launch two concepts:
  - **Nike Air Plus:** High-performance at $150 targeting active users.
  - **Nike Future:** Sustainable, stylish, eco-conscious design targeting Gen Z.
- Marketing campaigns focused on:
  - Instagram, TikTok influencers
  - Smart shoe tech and sustainability narratives
  - Customization and community engagement
